# 👋 Hi there! I'm Joshua

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about technology, innovation, and solving real-world problems through code. I'm currently focused on **Artificial Intelligence** applications in **vertical farming**, especially optimizing the growth of lettuce using computer vision, machine learning, and environmental control systems.

## 💡 About Me & Background

I'm Joshua, a Computer Engineering MSc student and researcher passionate about applying Artificial Intelligence to sustainable agriculture — particularly through vertical farming systems.

I'm currently developing an end-to-end AI pipeline for lettuce growth optimization using computer vision (YOLOv8), deep learning, and regression models. My goal is to help automate disease detection, classify growth stages, and predict yield using AI and environmental data.
